Microservices come with all kinds of great benefits. But they can be extremely difficult to manage well at scale. As organizations face the challenge of processing increasingly large volumes of data, they need to be able to build and maintain high-throughput data microservices. In this course, instructor Gregory Green covers the fundamental skills you need to know to meet todayâ€™s growing data demands with high-performance, scalable, high-throughput architectures.

Discover best practices for data patterns for throughput with flexible data services and multisite cloud-based use cases. Explore some of the most critical factors that affect high-throughput requirements, before diving deeper into antipatterns and the pros and cons of data technologies. Along the way, Gregory provides examples with RabbitMQ, Postgres, MySQL, Spring, and Apache Kafka, offering tips and pointers with hands-on demonstrations of how to design and implement successful, high-throughput data microservices.

## Overview 

Learn how to design, implement, and manage high throughput microservices for modern data architectures.


## Concept

Data is everywhere. Processing massive amounts of data requires microservices to be architected to meet many demands.
In this course, instructor [Gregory Green](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregory-green-5619748/) walks you through how to meet increasing data demands for Microservices by building scalable high-throughput architectures.
Discover best practices for data patterns for throughput with flexible data services and multisite cloud-based use cases. Explore some of the most critical factors that affect data microservices. Dive deeper into antipatterns and the pros and cons of data technologies, with examples drawn from RabbitMQ, Postgres, Caching, and Spring. Along the way, Gregory gives you tips and pointers with hands-on demonstrations of how to successfully design and implement performant data microservices.


## Goals

- Millions of payment transactions using [Spring](https://spring.io)/[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
- Compare throughput
  - relation databases: [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)/[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) 
  - Event Streaming: [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org)/[RabbitMQ Streams](https://www.rabbitmq.com/streams.html)
